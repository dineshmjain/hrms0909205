# üß† HRMS Backend ‚Äì Human Resource Management System

This is the backend of a full-featured Human Resource Management System (HRMS), built with **Express.js**, using **MongoDB** as the primary database, **Kafka** for message queuing, and **Redis** for caching. The system supports dynamic shift management, attendance, employee roles, organizational hierarchy, and more.

## üß™ Testing

Run the following command to execute unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

---

## üì¨ Kafka Topics

All Kafka logic is handled in `/utils/kafka/kafka.js`. The following topics are used:

- `user-logs`: Logs user-related activities.
- `user-update`: Handles updates to user profiles and roles.
- `attendance-update`: Processes attendance-related updates.

Tasks for each topic are managed in `/utils/taskHandler.js`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Docker Services

Docker is used to spin up supporting services like Kafka, Zookeeper, and Redis. To start the services, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## üìù Logging

- Error logs are stored in the `log` folder, with filenames based on the date (e.g., `results-YYYY-MM-DD.log`).
- Ensure the `log` folder has write permissions.
